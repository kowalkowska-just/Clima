# Clima
With this application you will be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

### In this project I used the API provided by openweathermap.org.

## What I learned in this app:
- How to create a dark-mode enabled app.
- How to use vector images as image assets.
- How to use the UITextField to get user input. 
- Delegate pattern.
- Swift protocols and extensions. 
- Swift closures and completion handlers.
- How to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
- Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
- How to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
- How to use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
